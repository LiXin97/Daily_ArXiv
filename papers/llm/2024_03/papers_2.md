| **[MatPlotAgent: Method and Evaluation for LLM-Based Agentic Scientific Data Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11453v3)** | <details>Scientific data visualization plays a crucial role in research by enabling the direct display of complex information and assisting researchers in identifying implicit patterns. Despite its importance, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific data visualization remains rather unexplored. In this study, we introduce MatPlotAgent, an efficient model-agnostic LLM agent framework designed to automate scientific data visualization tasks. Leveraging the capabilities of both code LLMs and multi-modal LLMs, MatPlotAgent consists of three core modules: query understanding, code generation with iterative debugging, and a visual feedback mechanism for error correction. To address the lack of benchmarks in this field, we present MatPlotBench, a high-quality benchmark consisting of 100 human-verified test cases. Additionally, we introduce a scoring approach that utilizes GPT-4V for automatic evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that MatPlotAgent can improve the performance of various LLMs, including both commercial and open-source models. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation method shows a strong correlation with human-annotated scores.</details> | 2024-03-19 | <details>Work in Progress</details> |
| **[Dysen-VDM: Empowering Dynamics-aware Text-to-Video Diffusion with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13812v2)** | <details>Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has gained increasing attention in the community, in which the recently emerged diffusion models (DMs) have promisingly shown stronger performance than the past approaches. While existing state-of-the-art DMs are competent to achieve high-resolution video generation, they may largely suffer from key limitations (e.g., action occurrence disorders, crude video motions) with respect to the intricate temporal dynamics modeling, one of the crux of video synthesis. In this work, we investigate strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs, for high-quality T2V generation. Inspired by human intuition, we design an innovative dynamic scene manager (dubbed as Dysen) module, which includes (step-1) extracting from input text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement, (step-2) transforming the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations, and (step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) via in-context learning, Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics understanding. Finally, the resulting video DSG with rich action scene details is encoded as fine-grained spatio-temporal features, integrated into the backbone T2V DM for video generating. Experiments on popular T2V datasets suggest that our Dysen-VDM consistently outperforms prior arts with significant margins, especially in scenarios with complex actions.

| **[Establishing Performance Baselines in Fine-Tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Soft-Prompting for Non-Specialist LLM Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05903v2)** | <details>Research into methods for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) through fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and soft-prompting has tended to focus on the use of highly technical or high-cost techniques, making many of the newly discovered approaches comparatively inaccessible to non-technical users. In this paper we tested an unmodified version of GPT 3.5, a fine-tuned version, and the same unmodified model when given access to a vectorised RAG database, both in isolation and in combination with a basic, non-algorithmic soft prompt. In each case we tested the model's ability to answer a set of 100 questions relating primarily to events that occurred after September 2021 (the point at which GPT 3.5's training data set ends). We found that if commercial platforms are used and default settings are applied with no iteration in order to establish a baseline set of outputs, a fine-tuned model outperforms GPT 3.5 Turbo, while the RAG approach out-performed both. The application of a soft prompt significantly improved the performance of each approach.</details> | 2024-03-19 | <details>10 pages, LaTeX; typos corrected, using the correct term 'system prompting' instead of 'soft prompting'</details> |
| **[Chart-based Reasoning: Transferring Capabilities from LLMs to VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12596v1)** | <details>Vision-language models (VLMs) are achieving increasingly strong performance on multimodal tasks. However, reasoning capabilities remain limited particularly for smaller VLMs, while those of large-language models (LLMs) have seen numerous improvements. We propose a technique to transfer capabilities from LLMs to VLMs. On the recently introduced ChartQA, our method obtains state-of-the-art performance when applied on the PaLI3-5B VLM by \citet{chen2023pali3}, while also enabling much better performance on PlotQA and FigureQA. We first improve the chart representation by continuing the pre-training stage using an improved version of the chart-to-table translation task by \citet{liu2023deplot}. We then propose constructing a 20x larger dataset than the original training set. To improve general reasoning capabilities and improve numerical operations, we synthesize reasoning traces using the table representation of charts. Lastly, our model is fine-tuned using the multitask loss introduced by \citet{hsieh2023distilling}. Our variant ChartPaLI-5B outperforms even 10x larger models such as PaLIX-55B without using an upstream OCR system, while keeping inference time constant compared to the PaLI3-5B baseline. When rationales are further refined with a simple program-of-thought prompt \cite{chen2023program}, our model outperforms the recently introduced Gemini Ultra and GPT-4V.</details> | 2024-03-19 | <details>Findings of NAACL 2024</details> |
| **[UniBind: LLM-Augmented Unified and Balanced Representation Space to Bind Them All](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12532v1)** | <details>We present UniBind, a flexible and efficient approach that learns a unified representation space for seven diverse modalities -- images, text, audio, point cloud, thermal, video, and event data. Existing works, eg., ImageBind, treat the image as the central modality and build an image-centered representation space; however, the space may be sub-optimal as it leads to an unbalanced representation space among all modalities. Moreover, the category names are directly used to extract text embeddings for the downstream tasks, making it hardly possible to represent the semantics of multi-modal data. The 'out-of-the-box' insight of our UniBind is to make the alignment center modality-agnostic and further learn a unified and balanced representation space, empowered by the large language models (LLMs). UniBind is superior in its flexible application to all CLIP-style models and delivers remarkable performance boosts. To make this possible, we 1) construct a knowledge base of text embeddings with the help of LLMs and multi-modal LLMs; 2) adaptively build LLM-augmented class-wise embedding center on top of the knowledge base and encoded visual embeddings; 3) align all the embeddings to the LLM-augmented embedding center via contrastive learning to achieve a unified and balanced representation space. UniBind shows strong zero-shot recognition performance gains over prior arts by an average of 6.36%. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance, eg., a 6.75% gain on ImageNet, on the multi-modal fine-tuning setting while reducing 90% of the learnable parameters.</details> | 2024-03-19 | <details>Accepted to CVPR2024</details> |
| **[VisionGPT: LLM-Assisted Real-Time Anomaly Detection for Safe Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12415v1)** | <details>This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models(LLMs) in zero-shot anomaly detection for safe visual navigation. With the assistance of the state-of-the-art real-time open-world object detection model Yolo-World and specialized prompts, the proposed framework can identify anomalies within camera-captured frames that include any possible obstacles, then generate concise, audio-delivered descriptions emphasizing abnormalities, assist in safe visual navigation in complex circumstances. Moreover, our proposed framework leverages the advantages of LLMs and the open-vocabulary object detection model to achieve the dynamic scenario switch, which allows users to transition smoothly from scene to scene, which addresses the limitation of traditional visual navigation. Furthermore, this paper explored the performance contribution of different prompt components, provided the vision for future improvement in visual accessibility, and paved the way for LLMs in video anomaly detection and vision-language understanding.</details> | 2024-03-19 |  |
| **[Towards Better Statistical Understanding of Watermarking LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13027v1)** | <details>In this paper, we study the problem of watermarking large language models (LLMs). We consider the trade-off between model distortion and detection ability and formulate it as a constrained optimization problem based on the green-red algorithm of Kirchenbauer et al. (2023a). We show that the optimal solution to the optimization problem enjoys a nice analytical property which provides a better understanding and inspires the algorithm design for the watermarking process. We develop an online dual gradient ascent watermarking algorithm in light of this optimization formulation and prove its asymptotic Pareto optimality between model distortion and detection ability. Such a result guarantees an averaged increased green list probability and henceforth detection ability explicitly (in contrast to previous results). Moreover, we provide a systematic discussion on the choice of the model distortion metrics for the watermarking problem. We justify our choice of KL divergence and present issues with the existing criteria of ``distortion-free'' and perplexity. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms on extensive datasets against benchmark algorithms.</details> | 2024-03-19 |  |
| **[OpenEval: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs across Capability, Alignment and Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12316v1)** | <details>The rapid development of Chinese large language models (LLMs) poses big challenges for efficient LLM evaluation. While current initiatives have introduced new benchmarks or evaluation platforms for assessing Chinese LLMs, many of these focus primarily on capabilities, usually overlooking potential alignment and safety issues. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEval, an evaluation testbed that benchmarks Chinese LLMs across capability, alignment and safety. For capability assessment, we include 12 benchmark datasets to evaluate Chinese LLMs from 4 sub-dimensions: NLP tasks, disciplinary knowledge, commonsense reasoning and mathematical reasoning. For alignment assessment, OpenEval contains 7 datasets that examines the bias, offensiveness and illegalness in the outputs yielded by Chinese LLMs. To evaluate safety, especially anticipated risks (e.g., power-seeking, self-awareness) of advanced LLMs, we include 6 datasets. In addition to these benchmarks, we have implemented a phased public evaluation and benchmark update strategy to ensure that OpenEval is in line with the development of Chinese LLMs or even able to provide cutting-edge benchmark datasets to guide the development of Chinese LLMs. In our first public evaluation, we have tested a range of Chinese LLMs, spanning from 7B to 72B parameters, including both open-source and proprietary models. Evaluation results indicate that while Chinese LLMs have shown impressive performance in certain tasks, more attention should be directed towards broader aspects such as commonsense reasoning, alignment, and safety.</details> | 2024-03-18 |  |
| **[Bridging the Gulf of Envisioning: Cognitive Design Challenges in LLM Interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14459v2)** | <details>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit dynamic capabilities and appear to comprehend complex and ambiguous natural language prompts. However, calibrating LLM interactions is challenging for interface designers and end-users alike. A central issue is our limited grasp of how human cognitive processes begin with a goal and form intentions for executing actions, a blindspot even in established interaction models such as Norman's gulfs of execution and evaluation. To address this gap, we theorize how end-users 'envision' translating their goals into clear intentions and craft prompts to obtain the desired LLM response. We define a process of Envisioning by highlighting three misalignments: (1) knowing whether LLMs can accomplish the task, (2) how to instruct the LLM to do the task, and (3) how to evaluate the success of the LLM's output in meeting the goal. Finally, we make recommendations to narrow the envisioning gulf in human-LLM interactions.</details> | 2024-03-18 |  |
| **[Context-aware LLM-based Safe Control Against Latent Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11863v1)** | <details>It is challenging for autonomous control systems to perform complex tasks in the presence of latent risks. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated framework that involves Large Language Models (LLMs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and optimization-based control. In the first phrase, the proposed framework breaks down complex tasks into a sequence of smaller subtasks, whose specifications account for contextual information and latent risks. In the second phase, these subtasks and their parameters are refined through a dual process involving LLMs and SGD. LLMs are used to generate rough guesses and failure explanations, and SGD is used to fine-tune parameters. The proposed framework is tested using simulated case studies of robots and vehicles. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.</details> | 2024-03-18 |  |
| **[Metaphor Understanding Challenge Dataset for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11810v1)** | <details>Metaphors in natural language are a reflection of fundamental cognitive processes such as analogical reasoning and categorisation, and are deeply rooted in everyday communication. Metaphor understanding is therefore an essential task for large language models (LLMs). We release the Metaphor Understanding Challenge Dataset (MUNCH), designed to evaluate the metaphor understanding capabilities of LLMs. The dataset provides over 10k paraphrases for sentences containing metaphor use, as well as 1.5k instances containing inapt paraphrases. The inapt paraphrases were carefully selected to serve as control to determine whether the model indeed performs full metaphor interpretation or rather resorts to lexical similarity. All apt and inapt paraphrases were manually annotated. The metaphorical sentences cover natural metaphor uses across 4 genres (academic, news, fiction, and conversation), and they exhibit different levels of novelty. Experiments with LLaMA and GPT-3.5 demonstrate that MUNCH presents a challenging task for LLMs. The dataset is freely accessible at https://github.com/xiaoyuisrain/metaphor-understanding-challenge.</details> | 2024-03-18 |  |
| **[LLM as a System Service on Mobile Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11805v1)** | <details>Being more powerful and intrusive into user-device interactions, LLMs are eager for on-device execution to better preserve user privacy. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of mobile AI: LLM as a system service on mobile devices (LLMaaS). Unlike traditional DNNs that execute in a stateless manner, such a system service is stateful: LLMs execution often needs to maintain persistent states (mainly KV cache) across multiple invocations. To minimize the LLM context switching overhead under tight device memory budget, this work presents LLMS, which decouples the memory management of app and LLM contexts with a key idea of fine-grained, chunk-wise, globally-optimized KV cache compression and swapping. By fully leveraging KV cache's unique characteristics, it proposes three novel techniques: (1) Tolerance-Aware Compression: it compresses chunks based on their measured accuracy tolerance to compression. (2) IO-Recompute Pipelined Loading: it introduces recompute to swapping-in for acceleration. (3) Chunk Lifecycle Management: it optimizes the memory activities of chunks with an ahead-of-time swapping-out and an LCTRU (Least Compression-Tolerable and Recently-Used) queue based eviction. In evaluations conducted on well-established traces and various edge devices, \sys reduces context switching latency by up to 2 orders of magnitude when compared to competitive baseline solutions.</details> | 2024-03-18 | <details>Technical Report</details> |
| **[ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838v2)** | <details>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</details> | 2024-03-18 | <details>This is a technical report from Nanyang Technological University</details> |
| **[MotionGPT: Finetuned LLMs Are General-Purpose Motion Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10900v2)** | <details>Generating realistic human motion from given action descriptions has experienced significant advancements because of the emerging requirement of digital humans. While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction.

| **[LLM Guided Evolution -- The Automation of Models Advancing Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11446v1)** | <details>In the realm of machine learning, traditional model development and automated approaches like AutoML typically rely on layers of abstraction, such as tree-based or Cartesian genetic programming. Our study introduces "Guided Evolution" (GE), a novel framework that diverges from these methods by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly modify code. GE leverages LLMs for a more intelligent, supervised evolutionary process, guiding mutations and crossovers. Our unique "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique further enhances GE by enabling LLMs to reflect on and learn from the outcomes of previous mutations. This results in a self-sustaining feedback loop that augments decision-making in model evolution. GE maintains genetic diversity, crucial for evolutionary algorithms, by leveraging LLMs' capability to generate diverse responses from expertly crafted prompts and modulate model temperature. This not only accelerates the evolution process but also injects expert like creativity and insight into the process. Our application of GE in evolving the ExquisiteNetV2 model demonstrates its efficacy: the LLM-driven GE autonomously produced variants with improved accuracy, increasing from 92.52% to 93.34%, without compromising model compactness. This underscores the potential of LLMs to accelerate the traditional model design pipeline, enabling models to autonomously evolve and enhance their own designs.</details> | 2024-03-18 |  |
| **[LLM-CXR: Instruction-Finetuned LLM for CXR Image Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11490v5)** | <details>Following the impressive development of LLMs, vision-language alignment in LLMs is actively being researched to enable multimodal reasoning and visual IO. This direction of research is particularly relevant to medical imaging because medical image analysis and generation consist of reasoning based on a combination of visual features and prior knowledge. Many recent works have focused on training adapter networks that serve as an information bridge between image processing networks and LLMs; but presumably, in order to achieve maximum reasoning potential of LLMs on visual information as well, visual and language features should be allowed to interact more freely. This is especially important in the medical domain because understanding and generating medical images such as chest X-rays (CXR) require not only accurate visual and language-based reasoning but also a more intimate mapping between the two modalities. Thus, taking inspiration from previous work on the transformer and VQ-GAN combination for bidirectional image and text generation, we build upon this approach and develop a method for instruction-tuning an LLM pre-trained only on text to gain vision-language capabilities for medical images. Specifically, we leverage a pretrained LLM's existing question-answering and instruction-following abilities to teach it to understand visual inputs by instructing it to answer questions about image inputs and, symmetrically, output both text and image responses appropriate to a given query by tuning the LLM with diverse tasks that encompass image-based text-generation and text-based image-generation. We show that our model, LLM-CXR, trained in this approach shows better image-text alignment in both CXR understanding and generation tasks while being smaller in size compared to previously developed models that perform a narrower range of tasks. The code is at https://github.com/hyn2028/llm-cxr.</details> | 2024-03-18 | <details>21 pages, 8 figures; ICLR 2024 (poster)</details> |
| **[StyleChat: Learning Recitation-Augmented Memory in LLMs for Stylized Dialogue Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11439v1)** | <details>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate superior performance in generative scenarios and have attracted widespread attention. Among them, stylized dialogue generation is essential in the context of LLMs for building intelligent and engaging dialogue agent. However the ability of LLMs is data-driven and limited by data bias, leading to poor performance on specific tasks. In particular, stylized dialogue generation suffers from a severe lack of supervised data. Furthermore, although many prompt-based methods have been proposed to accomplish specific tasks, their performance in complex real-world scenarios involving a wide variety of dialog styles further enhancement. In this work, we first introduce a stylized dialogue dataset StyleEval with 38 styles by leveraging the generative power of LLMs comprehensively, which has been carefully constructed with rigorous human-led quality control. Based on this, we propose the stylized dialogue framework StyleChat via recitation-augmented memory strategy and multi-task style learning strategy to promote generalization ability. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we created a test benchmark that included both a generation task and a choice task to comprehensively evaluate trained models and assess whether styles and preferences are remembered and understood. Experimental results show that our proposed framework StyleChat outperforms all the baselines and helps to break the style boundary of LLMs.</details> | 2024-03-18 |  |
| **[FastDecode: High-Throughput GPU-Efficient LLM Serving using Heterogeneous Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11421v1)** | <details>Cost of serving large language models (LLM) is high, but the expensive and scarce GPUs are poorly efficient when generating tokens sequentially, unless the batch of sequences is enlarged. However, the batch size is limited by some constantly reused intermediate results, namely KV-Cache. They occupy too much memory to fit more sequences into a GPU simultaneously. While they could be offloaded to host memory, the CPU-GPU bandwidth is an inevitable bottleneck. We find a way to decompose the transformer models into two parts of different characteristics, one of which includes the memory-bound KV-Cache accessing. Our key insight is that the aggregated memory capacity, bandwidth, and computing power of CPUs across multiple nodes is an efficient option to process this part. Performance improvement comes from reduced data transmission overhead and boosted GPU throughput to process the other model part. Moreover, we address efficiency challenges brought by heterogeneity at both temporal and inter-device scopes using scheduling and performance modeling techniques. Evaluation results show that our system achieves 1.88x - 5.04x the throughput of vLLM when serving modern LLMs with the same GPU.</details> | 2024-03-18 | <details>15 pages, 15 figures</details> |
| **[SmartPlay: A Benchmark for LLMs as Intelligent Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01557v5)** | <details>Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential toward intelligent agents and next-gen automation, but there currently lacks a systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' abilities as agents. We introduce SmartPlay: both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs as agents. SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM agents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies. We release our benchmark at github.com/Microsoft/SmartPlay</details> | 2024-03-17 |  |
| **[Driving Style Alignment for LLM-powered Driver Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11368v1)** | <details>Recently, LLM-powered driver agents have demonstrated considerable potential in the field of autonomous driving, showcasing human-like reasoning and decision-making abilities.However, current research on aligning driver agent behaviors with human driving styles remains limited, partly due to the scarcity of high-quality natural language data from human driving behaviors.To address this research gap, we propose a multi-alignment framework designed to align driver agents with human driving styles through demonstrations and feedback. Notably, we construct a natural language dataset of human driver behaviors through naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving interviews, offering high-quality human demonstrations for LLM alignment. The framework's effectiveness is validated through simulation experiments in the CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated by human evaluations. Our research offers valuable insights into designing driving agents with diverse driving styles.The implementation of the framework and details of the dataset can be found at the link.</details> | 2024-03-17 |  |
| **[Few-Shot VQA with Frozen LLMs: A Tale of Two Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11317v1)** | <details>Two approaches have emerged to input images into large language models (LLMs). The first is to caption images into natural language. The second is to map image feature embeddings into the domain of the LLM and pass the mapped embeddings directly to the LLM. The majority of recent few-shot multimodal work reports performance using architectures that employ variations of one of these two approaches. But they overlook an important comparison between them. We design a controlled and focused experiment to compare these two approaches to few-shot visual question answering (VQA) with LLMs. Our findings indicate that for Flan-T5 XL, a 3B parameter LLM, connecting visual embeddings directly to the LLM embedding space does not guarantee improved performance over using image captions. In the zero-shot regime, we find using textual image captions is better. In the few-shot regimes, how the in-context examples are selected determines which is better.</details> | 2024-03-17 |  |
| **[Tokenizer Choice For LLM Training: Negligible or Crucial?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08754v4)** | <details>The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been predominantly driven by curating the training dataset composition, scaling of model architectures and dataset sizes and advancements in pretraining objectives, leaving tokenizer influence as a blind spot. Shedding light on this underexplored area, we conduct a comprehensive study on the influence of tokenizer choice on LLM downstream performance by training 24 mono- and multilingual LLMs at a 2.6B parameter scale, ablating different tokenizer algorithms and parameterizations. Our studies highlight that the tokenizer choice can significantly impact the model's downstream performance and training costs. In particular, we find that the common tokenizer evaluation metrics fertility and parity are not always predictive of model downstream performance, rendering these metrics a questionable proxy for the model's downstream performance. Furthermore, we show that multilingual tokenizers trained on the five most frequent European languages require vocabulary size increases of factor three in comparison to English. While English-centric tokenizers have been applied to the training of multi-lingual LLMs in the past, we find that this approach results in a severe downstream performance degradation and additional training costs of up to 68%, due to an inefficient tokenization vocabulary.</details> | 2024-03-17 |  |
| **[LatEval: An Interactive LLMs Evaluation Benchmark with Incomplete Information from Lateral Thinking Puzzles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10855v3)** | <details>With the continuous evolution and refinement of LLMs, they are endowed with impressive logical reasoning or vertical thinking capabilities. But can they think out of the box? Do they possess proficient lateral thinking abilities? Following the setup of Lateral Thinking Puzzles, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, LatEval, which assesses the model's lateral thinking within an interactive framework. In our benchmark, we challenge LLMs with 2 aspects: the quality of questions posed by the model and the model's capability to integrate information for problem-solving. We find that nearly all LLMs struggle with employing lateral thinking during interactions. For example, even the most advanced model, GPT-4, exhibits the advantage to some extent, yet still maintain a noticeable gap when compared to human. This evaluation benchmark provides LLMs with a highly challenging and distinctive task that is crucial to an effective AI assistant.</details> | 2024-03-17 | <details>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024</details> |
| **[Evaluation Ethics of LLMs in Legal Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11152v1)** | <details>In recent years, the utilization of large language models for natural language dialogue has gained momentum, leading to their widespread adoption across various domains. However, their universal competence in addressing challenges specific to specialized fields such as law remains a subject of scrutiny. The incorporation of legal ethics into the model has been overlooked by researchers. We asserts that rigorous ethic evaluation is essential to ensure the effective integration of large language models in legal domains, emphasizing the need to assess domain-specific proficiency and domain-specific ethic. To address this, we propose a novelty evaluation methodology, utilizing authentic legal cases to evaluate the fundamental language abilities, specialized legal knowledge and legal robustness of large language models (LLMs). The findings from our comprehensive evaluation contribute significantly to the academic discourse surrounding the suitability and performance of large language models in legal domains.</details> | 2024-03-17 | <details>10 pages, in processing of ACL 2024</details> |
| **[Can LLMs Express Their Uncertainty? An Empirical Evaluation of Confidence Elicitation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13063v2)** | <details>Empowering large language models to accurately express confidence in their answers is essential for trustworthy decision-making. Previous confidence elicitation methods, which primarily rely on white-box access to internal model information or model fine-tuning, have become less suitable for LLMs, especially closed-source commercial APIs. This leads to a growing need to explore the untapped area of black-box approaches for LLM uncertainty estimation. To better break down the problem, we define a systematic framework with three components: prompting strategies for eliciting verbalized confidence, sampling methods for generating multiple responses, and aggregation techniques for computing consistency. We then benchmark these methods on two key tasks-confidence calibration and failure prediction-across five types of datasets (e.g., commonsense and arithmetic reasoning) and five widely-used LLMs including GPT-4 and LLaMA 2 Chat. Our analysis uncovers several key insights: 1) LLMs, when verbalizing their confidence, tend to be overconfident, potentially imitating human patterns of expressing confidence. 2) As model capability scales up, both calibration and failure prediction performance improve. 3) Employing our proposed strategies, such as human-inspired prompts, consistency among multiple responses, and better aggregation strategies can help mitigate this overconfidence from various perspectives. 4) Comparisons with white-box methods indicate that while white-box methods perform better, the gap is narrow, e.g., 0.522 to 0.605 in AUROC. Despite these advancements, none of these techniques consistently outperform others, and all investigated methods struggle in challenging tasks, such as those requiring professional knowledge, indicating significant scope for improvement. We believe this study can serve as a strong baseline and provide insights for eliciting confidence in black-box LLMs.</details> | 2024-03-17 | <details>The paper is accepted by ICLR 2024.

| **[Compressing LLMs: The Truth is Rarely Pure and Never Simple](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01382v2)** | <details>Despite their remarkable achievements, modern Large Language Models (LLMs) face exorbitant computational and memory footprints. Recently, several works have shown significant success in training-free and data-free compression (pruning and quantization) of LLMs that achieve 50 - 60% sparsity and reduce the bit width to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible degradation of perplexity over the uncompressed baseline. As recent research efforts are focused on developing increasingly sophisticated compression methods, our work takes a step back and re-evaluates the effectiveness of existing SoTA compression methods, which rely on a fairly simple and widely questioned metric, perplexity (even for dense LLMs). We introduce Knowledge-Intensive Compressed LLM BenchmarK (LLM-KICK), a collection of carefully curated tasks to redefine the evaluation protocol for compressed LLMs, which have significant alignment with their dense counterparts and perplexity fail to capture subtle change in their true capabilities. LLM-KICK unveils many favorable merits and unfortunate plights of current SoTA compression methods: all pruning methods suffer significant performance degradation, sometimes at trivial sparsity ratios (e.g., 25-30%), and fail for N:M sparsity in knowledge-intensive tasks; current quantization methods are more successful than pruning; yet, pruned LLMs even at $\geq 50$% sparsity are robust in-context retrieval and summarization systems; among others. LLM-KICK is designed to holistically access compressed LLMs' ability for language understanding, reasoning, generation, in-context retrieval, in-context summarization, etc. We hope our study can foster the development of better LLM compression methods. The reproduced codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/llm-kick.</details> | 2024-03-17 | <details>Accepted to ICLR 2024</details> |
| **[FlowMind: Automatic Workflow Generation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13050v1)** | <details>The rapidly evolving field of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has made significant strides in automating repetitive processes, yet its effectiveness diminishes in scenarios requiring spontaneous or unpredictable tasks demanded by users. This paper introduces a novel approach, FlowMind, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), to address this limitation and create an automatic workflow generation system. In FlowMind, we propose a generic prompt recipe for a lecture that helps ground LLM reasoning with reliable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). With this, FlowMind not only mitigates the common issue of hallucinations in LLMs, but also eliminates direct interaction between LLMs and proprietary data or code, thus ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information - a cornerstone in financial services. FlowMind further simplifies user interaction by presenting high-level descriptions of auto-generated workflows, enabling users to inspect and provide feedback effectively. We also introduce NCEN-QA, a new dataset in finance for benchmarking question-answering tasks from N-CEN reports on funds. We used NCEN-QA to evaluate the performance of workflows generated by FlowMind against baseline and ablation variants of FlowMind. We demonstrate the success of FlowMind, the importance of each component in the proposed lecture recipe, and the effectiveness of user interaction and feedback in FlowMind.</details> | 2024-03-17 | <details>Published in ACM ICAIF 2023</details> |
| **[Can we Soft Prompt LLMs for Graph Learning Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10359v2)** | <details>Graph plays an important role in representing complex relationships in real-world applications such as social networks, biological data and citation networks. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various domains, which makes applying LLMs to graphs particularly appealing. However, directly applying LLMs to graph modalities presents unique challenges due to the discrepancy and mismatch between the graph and text modalities. Hence, to further investigate LLMs' potential for comprehending graph information, we introduce GraphPrompter, a novel framework designed to align graph information with LLMs via soft prompts. Specifically, GraphPrompter consists of two main components: a graph neural network to encode complex graph information and an LLM that effectively processes textual information. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets under node classification and link prediction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The GraphPrompter framework unveils the substantial capabilities of LLMs as predictors in graph-related tasks, enabling researchers to utilize LLMs across a spectrum of real-world graph scenarios more effectively.</details> | 2024-03-16 | <details>Accepted by The Web Conference (WWW) 2024 Short Paper Track</details> |

| **[SERVAL: Synergy Learning between Vertical Models and LLMs towards Oracle-Level Zero-shot Medical Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01570v2)** | <details>Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has exhibited impressive zero-shot proficiency on generic and common sense questions. However, LLMs' application on domain-specific vertical questions still lags behind, primarily due to the humiliation problems and deficiencies in vertical knowledge. Furthermore, the vertical data annotation process often requires labor-intensive expert involvement, thereby presenting an additional challenge in enhancing the model's vertical capabilities. In this paper, we propose SERVAL, a synergy learning pipeline designed for unsupervised development of vertical capabilities in both LLMs and small models by mutual enhancement. Specifically, SERVAL utilizes the LLM's zero-shot outputs as annotations, leveraging its confidence to teach a robust vertical model from scratch. Reversely, the trained vertical model guides the LLM fine-tuning to enhance its zero-shot capability, progressively improving both models through an iterative process. In medical domain, known for complex vertical knowledge and costly annotations, comprehensive experiments show that, without access to any gold labels, SERVAL with the synergy learning of OpenAI GPT-3.5 and a simple model attains fully-supervised competitive performance across ten widely used medical datasets. These datasets represent vertically specialized medical diagnostic scenarios (e.g., diabetes, heart diseases, COVID-19), highlighting the potential of SERVAL in refining the vertical capabilities of LLMs and training vertical models from scratch, all achieved without the need for annotations.</details> | 2024-03-16 |  |
| **[Can Knowledge Graphs Reduce Hallucinations in LLMs? : A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07914v2)** | <details>The contemporary LLMs are prone to producing hallucinations, stemming mainly from the knowledge gaps within the models. To address this critical limitation, researchers employ diverse strategies to augment the LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, aiming to reduce hallucinations and enhance reasoning accuracy. Among these strategies, leveraging knowledge graphs as a source of external information has demonstrated promising results. In this survey, we comprehensively review these knowledge-graph-based augmentation techniques in LLMs, focusing on their efficacy in mitigating hallucinations. We systematically categorize these methods into three overarching groups, offering methodological comparisons and performance evaluations. Lastly, this survey explores the current trends and challenges associated with these techniques and outlines potential avenues for future research in this emerging field.</details> | 2024-03-16 | <details>Accepted Paper in NAACL 2024</details> |
| **[LLM-based Conversational AI Therapist for Daily Functioning Screening and Psychotherapeutic Intervention via Everyday Smart Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10779v1)** | <details>Despite the global mental health crisis, access to screenings, professionals, and treatments remains high. In collaboration with licensed psychotherapists, we propose a Conversational AI Therapist with psychotherapeutic Interventions (CaiTI), a platform that leverages large language models (LLM)s and smart devices to enable better mental health self-care. CaiTI can screen the day-to-day functioning using natural and psychotherapeutic conversations. CaiTI leverages reinforcement learning to provide personalized conversation flow. CaiTI can accurately understand and interpret user responses. When the user needs further attention during the conversation, CaiTI can provide conversational psychotherapeutic interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI). Leveraging the datasets prepared by the licensed psychotherapists, we experiment and microbenchmark various LLMs' performance in tasks along CaiTI's conversation flow and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. With the psychotherapists, we implement CaiTI and conduct 14-day and 24-week studies. The study results, validated by therapists, demonstrate that CaiTI can converse with users naturally, accurately understand and interpret user responses, and provide psychotherapeutic interventions appropriately and effectively. We showcase the potential of CaiTI LLMs to assist the mental therapy diagnosis and treatment and improve day-to-day functioning screening and precautionary psychotherapeutic intervention systems.</details> | 2024-03-16 |  |
| **[Demystifying Faulty Code with LLM: Step-by-Step Reasoning for Explainable Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10507v1)** | <details>Fault localization is a critical process that involves identifying specific program elements responsible for program failures. Manually pinpointing these elements, such as classes, methods, or statements, which are associated with a fault is laborious and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, various fault localization tools have been developed. These tools typically generate a ranked list of suspicious program elements. However, this information alone is insufficient. A prior study emphasized that automated fault localization should offer a rationale. In this study, we investigate the step-by-step reasoning for explainable fault localization. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLM) in assisting developers in reasoning about code. We proposed FuseFL that utilizes several combinations of information to enhance the LLM results which are spectrum-based fault localization results, test case execution outcomes, and code description (i.e., explanation of what the given code is intended to do). We conducted our investigation using faulty code from Refactory dataset. First, we evaluate the performance of the automated fault localization. Our results demonstrate a more than 30% increase in the number of successfully localized faults at Top-1 compared to the baseline. To evaluate the explanations generated by FuseFL, we create a dataset of human explanations that provide step-by-step reasoning as to why specific lines of code are considered faulty. This dataset consists of 324 faulty code files, along with explanations for 600 faulty lines. Furthermore, we also conducted human studies to evaluate the explanations. We found that for 22 out of the 30 randomly sampled cases, FuseFL generated correct explanations.</details> | 2024-03-15 | <details>To be appeared at 2024 IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)</details> |
| **[S3LLM: Large-Scale Scientific Software Understanding with LLMs using Source, Metadata, and Document](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10588v1)** | <details>The understanding of large-scale scientific software poses significant challenges due to its diverse codebase, extensive code length, and target computing architectures. The emergence of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), provides novel pathways for understanding such complex scientific codes. This paper presents S3LLM, an LLM-based framework designed to enable the examination of source code, code metadata, and summarized information in conjunction with textual technical reports in an interactive, conversational manner through a user-friendly interface. S3LLM leverages open-source LLaMA-2 models to enhance code analysis through the automatic transformation of natural language queries into domain-specific language (DSL) queries. Specifically, it translates these queries into Feature Query Language (FQL), enabling efficient scanning and parsing of entire code repositories. In addition, S3LLM is equipped to handle diverse metadata types, including DOT, SQL, and customized formats. Furthermore, S3LLM incorporates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and LangChain technologies to directly query extensive documents. S3LLM demonstrates the potential of using locally deployed open-source LLMs for the rapid understanding of large-scale scientific computing software, eliminating the need for extensive coding expertise, and thereby making the process more efficient and effective.
